  <p class="card-text"><b>Ken: Choosing the Right UTV  </b></p>
  <p class="card-text">Ken, a farmer in western Kansas who is a double lower leg amputee, needed to figure out what utility vehicle (UTV) would work for him so he could continue to spray weeds on his farm, check fence line, and monitor his livestock. Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) staff wanted to demonstrate multiple UTVs without requiring Ken to make trips to different vendors. </p>                                                                                                 <p class="card-text">ATK staff organized an event with commercial dealers of four different types of UTVs. At the event, ATK staff and Ken compared features of the different vehicles, their load beds, and spraying options. This information will be part of the recommendations to Ken’s vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselor.</p><p class="card-text">Six other ATK customers, four VR counselors, a VR regional manager, and 50 community members attended the event, along with 11 vendors from four states. Several vendors noted that this opened a new market for them as they learned to discuss features of their products that are relevant to people with disabilities. One presenter told ATK staff that having the support of the sign language interpreters helped him interact with all members of his audience.</p>

  <p class="card-text"><b>Ahmed: AT for Gaming </b></p>  
  <p class="card-text">Making video games accessible allows young people with disabilities to engage with their peers in new ways. A team from the New England AT Center (NEAT Center) worked with Ahmed, a 15-year-old who was looking for better ways to game despite the challenges of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. </p>         <p class="card-text">Ahmed uses a power wheelchair and has limited mobility in his arms. He can hold a typical game controller and access all of its buttons, but experiences hand fatigue when playing for long periods or physically demanding games.</p>

 <p class="card-text">As part of the demo, NEAT Center staff looked at Ahmed’s physical positioning when he plays and tried a few low-tech solutions to make playing more comfortable and ergonomic. They explored in-system accessibility features to revamp Ahmed’s controller. Lastly, they did a demo of a specialized adapted controller and it completely changed his game play.</p><p class="card-text">Ahmed agreed that the adapted controller would meet his needs and he was referred to our lending library to borrow the device until he can get one of his own.</p>

<p class="card-text">Emma is a 13-year-old who is not able to attend her local public school and interact with her peers because of her disability. Bartlesville Public Schools (BPS) borrowed the Double Robot from Oklahoma ABLE Tech. The robot is a telepresence tool that allowed Emma to have access to the classroom and her peers while at home. </p>              <p class="card-text">The Double Robot enabled Emma to attend and participate fully in her core classes and receive live instruction. It has been so well received that BPS Foundation submitted a grant proposal to pilot a Double Robot for the next school year.</p>

  <p class="card-text"><b>Luis Finds the Right Walker</b> </p>

  <p class="card-text">Luis is a 7-year-old boy who underwent surgery due to his motor disabilities. He was discharged from the hospital in a wheelchair. After several weeks, his doctor authorized him to walk again using a mobility device to help maintain stability. </p>                                                                             <p class="card-text">Luis’ parents contacted the Puerto Rico AT Program (PRATP) to inquire about a walker that would fit his particular needs. They could not afford to buy the options offered by suppliers. Through PRATP’s AT reuse program, Luis was fitted with a walker appropriate for his size and needs. </p>                  <p class="card-text">As soon as the fitting was finished, Luis started walking with the device and he did not let it go for the duration of the service. When he left, he was happy getting around with his walker and PRATP staffers were overjoyed to see him moving again. </p>

<p><img style="max-width:200px;" src="/assets/LA_State_Financing.jpg" alt="Latrisa using magnifier hardware" class="img-fluid float-left pb-2 pr-2">
<p class="card-text">Latrisa, a single mom, became partially blind in January 2017. She learned about the Louisiana Assistive Technology Access Network (LATAN), and became familiar with some assistive devices for vision, including an Amigo HD video magnifier and MAGic Screen Reading and Magnification Software. </p>                                                                                                                                               <p class="card-text">Latrisa was able to use LATAN’s new AT Lease Program to help her to afford the devices she needed to see. She reported that being able to lease the devices allowed her a little freedom, and she was able to get a seasonal job with Amazon because she has this assistive technology. </p>
