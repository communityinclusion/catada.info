  <p class="card-text">Ken: Choosing the Right UTV  </p>
  <p class="card-text">Ken, a farmer in western Kansas who is a double lower leg amputee, needed to figure out what utility vehicle (UTV) would work for him so he could continue to spray weeds on his farm, check fence line, and monitor his livestock. Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) staff wanted to demonstrate multiple UTVs without requiring Ken to make trips to different vendors. </p>                                                                                                 <p class="card-text">ATK staff organized an event with commercial dealers of four different types of UTVs. At the event, ATK staff and Ken compared features of the different vehicles, their load beds, and spraying options. This information will be part of the recommendations to Ken’s vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselor.</p><p class="card-text">Six other ATK customers, four VR counselors, a VR regional manager, and 50 community members attended the event, along with 11 vendors from four states. Several vendors noted that this opened a new market for them as they learned to discuss features of their products that are relevant to people with disabilities. One presenter told ATK staff that having the support of the sign language interpreters helped him interact with all members of his audience.</p>

  <p class="card-text">Ahmed: AT for Gaming </p>
  <p class="card-text">Making video games accessible allows young people with disabilities to engage with their peers in new ways. A team from the New England AT Center (NEAT Center) worked with Ahmed, a 15-year-old who was looking for better ways to game despite the challenges of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. </p>         <p class="card-text">Ahmed uses a power wheelchair and has limited mobility in his arms. He can hold a typical game controller and access all of its buttons, but experiences hand fatigue when playing for long periods or physically demanding games.</p>

 <p class="card-text">As part of the demo, NEAT Center staff looked at Ahmed’s physical positioning when he plays and tried a few low-tech solutions to make playing more comfortable and ergonomic. They explored in-system accessibility features to revamp Ahmed’s controller. Lastly, they did a demo of a specialized adapted controller and it completely changed his game play.</p><p class="card-text">Ahmed agreed that the adapted controller would meet his needs and he was referred to our lending library to borrow the device until he can get one of his own.</p>

<p class="card-text">Being fed by his parents at home wasn’t a big deal for Heath. As a fourth grader with cerebral palsy, he was used to it. But being fed at school in front of his peers? “It was just really weird having other people watching me while I was getting fed by an adult,” he explained. </p>              <p class="card-text">MonTECH (Montana’s AT Program) arranged for a trial of Obi, a robotic feeding companion. Heath’s multiple test drives of Obi showed he was able to use Obi to eat independently. Coupled with mom Jenny’s research about the health benefits of self-feeding, the Montgomerys were able to pursue funding for an Obi for Heath.</p>                                                                                         <p class="card-text">Now Heath’s Obi allows him to eat independently at school, at home, and in restaurants. Heath’s classmate confirms the cool factor: “We think it’s just really awesome that Heath can eat by himself without his mom.”</p>

  <p><img style="max-width:200px;" src="/assets/NC_device_Reutilization.jpg" alt="reclining wheelchair" class="img-fluid float-left pb-2 pr-2"></p>
  <p class="card-text">In August 2018, 17 months after Hurricane Matthew hit North Carolina, the North Carolina Assistive Technology Program (NCATP) got a call from NC Emergency Management regarding two hurricane survivors needing AT and durable medical equipment. The survivors needed a manual reclining wheelchair, a standing lift, an electric hospital bed, and a lift chair. Both individuals lived in the Roberson County area (a very rural portion of NC). </p>                                                                             <p class="card-text">Frank Harden, NCATP’s reuse coordinator, contacted individuals across the state to locate the items needed. Within hours, he found a gentleman near Raleigh who had recently lost his wife from a lengthy illness. He wanted to donate durable medical equipment to the NCATP reuse program. The items to be donated were exactly the items needed by the two hurricane survivors. </p>                  <p class="card-text">NCATP arranged for pickup and delivery to the survivors, about 2 hours from Raleigh, and within 2 days of the original request, they had all the equipment they needed. </p>

<p class="card-text">Latrisa, a single mom, became partially blind in January 2017. She learned about the Louisiana Assistive Technology Access Network (LATAN), and became familiar with some assistive devices for vision, including an Amigo HD video magnifier and MAGic Screen Reading and Magnification Software. </p>                                                                                                                                               <p class="card-text">Latrisa was able to use LATAN’s new AT Lease Program to help her to afford the devices she needed to see. She reported that being able to lease the devices allowed her a little freedom, and she was able to get a seasonal job with Amazon because she has this assistive technology. </p>
