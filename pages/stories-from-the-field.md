 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Demonstration2.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="J.P and wife">Joe, a social and resilient individual who has survived a brain tumor resection and a stroke, uses a communication device to stay connected with family, friends, and his community. His current device was outdated, so through the Ability Tools program, he borrowed an Accent 1000 to compare it with his existing Accent 1400. After an extended trial, Joe found he could communicate faster with the smaller Accent 1000 but ultimately felt the Accent 1400 better suited his needs. He is now awaiting insurance approval to receive a new Accent 1400 as his permanent replacement.</p>

Katie contacted the Oregon AT Program’s lending library for mobility equipment for an upcoming trip. Her grandmother and mother were visiting to experience the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, with a highlight being her grandmother’s lifelong dream of seeing the redwoods. To meet her grandmother’s mobility needs, Katie and her mother researched ADA-accessible trails in the area. Katie borrowed a manual wheelchair and a rolling walker with a seat from the lending library to make the trip easier. </p>              

<p class="card-text">The visit was a success, and Katie shared, “Even though I knew the forest was majestic, I was surprised by how deeply it moved my grandmother. She kept thanking us and telling strangers that visiting the redwoods was on her bucket list—and that her daughter and granddaughter had made it happen. Without the lending library, none of this would’ve been possible.”</p>

The admissions officer for the Alabama State Bar Exam contacted Alabama’s Assistive Technology Resource (APTAT). The Bar Office was referred to APTAT by vocational rehabilitation for assistive technology support. Two examinees had requested accommodations, and each visited APTAT to trial devices from our library. One explored mobile standing desks and ergonomic mice; the other tested CCTVs, text-to-speech tools, keyboards, and screen magnification. Each selected a setup tailored to their needs. APTAT delivered and set up the devices at the exam site for their three-day exam. The Bar Office was grateful for the support, and we were proud to contribute to such an important event!</p>

  <p class="card-text"><b>Rain, Grain, and All-Terrain: Navigating Farm Life with an M3 Power Chair</b> </p>
 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Reuse1.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Linda in wheelchair">
Ranchers wear boots for a reason—they’re built for the rough terrain of pastureland and cattle corrals. Now, imagine navigating that same ground in a wheelchair. That’s daily life for Bret, who checks fences, feeds cattle, and tags calves using a manual or power wheelchair, an ATV, or a pickup with a lift. After a 2004 accident left him with a spinal cord injury, Bret adapted—but most power wheelchairs aren’t made for rugged ranch work. He’s worn out many wheelchairs, and even with heavy-duty models, tasks like tossing grain, fixing fences, or vaccinating over 150 cattle each season remain physically taxing. That changed when Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) provided a used Permobil Corpus M3 power chair with a 12-inch seat elevation.</p>                                                                                       <p class="card-text">Bret immediately saw the benefits. “There’s a fridge right next to the chute with the vaccines,” he said. “Being able to turn on a dime and raise the seat makes a huge difference. I can work more independently, and it’s eased the strain on my shoulders—especially important since I recently found out I have two torn rotator cuffs.”</p>

Eduard, an 8th grader with cerebral palsy receiving outpatient Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) services at the CIDE Assistive Technology Clinic, was a recipient of one of the Assistive Technology Program of Colorado’s open-ended loans. He came to our clinic with a Tobi I5 and eye gaze system but no mount to secure it to his wheelchair, rendering it unusable. Since he wasn't due for a new device for another two years, he was provided with a device mount. Using the mount in conjunction with his Tobi I5 has transformed Eduard's life. He now uses his AAC device regularly and has access to a means of communication at school, at home, and in the community. One of his teacher’s states, “He is a completely different kid and is now interacting with his peers and other teachers.” </p>

Fourth grader JD has significant hearing loss in both ears. His parents’ insurance does not cover the full cost of hearing aids. JD’s mom is a teacher and was not comfortable approaching the school for funding assistance. Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) staff obtained $3,500 from private funders to cover the remaining costs of JD’s hearing aids. His mom and teacher say he’s like a different boy. He tells everyone about new sounds he hears. JD is excited about his progress on his speech with the increased amplification, and he is eager to go to school every day now.</p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/State-Financing2.png" class="float-right img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Large, black modified vehicle">
Phil had been working with the Oklahoma Department of Rehabilitation Services (OKDRS) and his bank for almost two years to replace his existing modified vehicle that was over 18 years old. He applied for and received a low-interest loan through ABLE Tech’s Financial Loan Program. With this loan and support from OKDRS, Phil was able to get the vehicle he needed.</p>                                                                   

<p class="card-text">Phil shared, “ABLE Tech came through for me when others didn’t, and I couldn’t be more thankful! Here’s to hoping for another life-long dependable truck.” The Alternative Financial Loan Program is a great way to supplement additional funding in collaboration with other programs, such as OKDRS. “It was a pleasure to assist Phil in his employment goals by providing funding for his modified vehicle.”</p>
