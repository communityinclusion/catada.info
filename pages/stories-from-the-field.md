 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Demonstration2.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="J.P and wife">Joe, a social and resilient individual who has survived a brain tumor resection and a stroke, uses a communication device to stay connected with family, friends, and his community. His current device was outdated, so through the Ability Tools program, he borrowed an Accent 1000 to compare it with his existing Accent 1400. After an extended trial, Joe found he could communicate faster with the smaller Accent 1000 but ultimately felt the Accent 1400 better suited his needs. He is now awaiting insurance approval to receive a new Accent 1400 as his permanent replacement.</p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Loan1.png" class="float-right img-fluid w-25" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Gerald in standing frame">
Katie contacted the Oregon AT Program’s lending library for mobility equipment for an upcoming trip. Her grandmother and mother were visiting to experience the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, with a highlight being her grandmother’s lifelong dream of seeing the redwoods. To meet her grandmother’s mobility needs, Katie and her mother researched ADA-accessible trails in the area. Katie borrowed a manual wheelchair and a rolling walker with a seat from the lending library to make the trip easier. </p>              

<p class="card-text">The visit was a success, and Katie shared, “Even though I knew the forest was majestic, I was surprised by how deeply it moved my grandmother. She kept thanking us and telling strangers that visiting the redwoods was on her bucket list—and that her daughter and granddaughter had made it happen. Without the lending library, none of this would’ve been possible.”</p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Loan2.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Ms. CJ with keyboard at desk">
Ms. CJ is currently employed with Lowe’s Corp. as a Workforce Supervisor in Wilkesboro, NC. Initially, Ms. CJ was concerned about how she would use the keyboard at her job with only one hand. North Carolina Assistive Technology Program staff introduced a few assistive technology options, including a one-handed keyboard, Five Finger Typist software, and speech recognition software.</p>            

<p class="card-text">Ms. CJ tested a few options at work. First, she tried the RH Maltron Keyboard, a uniquely shaped, one-handed keyboard that optimizes layout to minimize finger movement by having the more common letters closer to the finger “home position.” Next, she borrowed the trial version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which allows individuals to create text from their voice, along with a noise canceling headset and microphone. Ms. CJ reported that she loved the technologies and was much more productive at work. She and her employer requested information on how to purchase the items for Ms. CJ to use in her Workforce Supervisor role.</p>

 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Reuse1.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Linda in wheelchair">
Linda has limited mobility due to pain from chronic back issues and arthritis. She had been using a walker inside her apartment but has had difficulty traveling from her front door to the mailbox. Linda did not typically have the stamina to manage the uphill grade to the entrance of the local grocery store, or to cross the busy street before the traffic light changed.</p>                                                                                       <p class="card-text">Linda came to the Meyer Medical Equipment Center, operated by Washington AT Program’s device reuse partner, Bridge Disability Ministries, hoping to find a free or low-cost solution that would work for her fixed budget. Linda and the Center staff determined that a small (but powerful) electric scooter that could fit in her apartment would work well. The Center delivered the scooter to her home and helped adjust it to fit her body. On the first try, Linda was able to use the scooter to get up the hill, cross the street at the traffic light with time to spare, and enter the grocery store, which she had been unable to visit for months! Linda looks forward to using the scooter to regain her mobility and independence.	 </p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Reuse2.png" class="float-right img-fluid w-25-lg" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Addie holding an instrument">
The best part of marching band is being at the games! At least that’s what Addie tells us. Addie received a power assist wheelchair from Assistive Technology for Kansans Reuse so she could keep up with her friends at school. Band students must cross a parking lot to get to the band building. Now, Addie can keep up when friends race up an incline to the cafeteria to grab lunch. She can also ride the school bus more easily, so she never has to miss the away games! </p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/State-Financing1.png" class="float-left img-fluid w-25" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="JD wearing hearing aid">
Fourth grader JD has significant hearing loss in both ears. His parents’ insurance does not cover the full cost of hearing aids. JD’s mom is a teacher and was not comfortable approaching the school for funding assistance. Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) staff obtained $3,500 from private funders to cover the remaining costs of JD’s hearing aids. His mom and teacher say he’s like a different boy. He tells everyone about new sounds he hears. JD is excited about his progress on his speech with the increased amplification, and he is eager to go to school every day now.</p>

<p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/State-Financing2.png" class="float-right img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Large, black modified vehicle">
Phil had been working with the Oklahoma Department of Rehabilitation Services (OKDRS) and his bank for almost two years to replace his existing modified vehicle that was over 18 years old. He applied for and received a low-interest loan through ABLE Tech’s Financial Loan Program. With this loan and support from OKDRS, Phil was able to get the vehicle he needed.</p>                                                                   

<p class="card-text">Phil shared, “ABLE Tech came through for me when others didn’t, and I couldn’t be more thankful! Here’s to hoping for another life-long dependable truck.” The Alternative Financial Loan Program is a great way to supplement additional funding in collaboration with other programs, such as OKDRS. “It was a pleasure to assist Phil in his employment goals by providing funding for his modified vehicle.”</p>
