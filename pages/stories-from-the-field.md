 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Demonstration2.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="J.P and wife">Joe, a social and resilient individual who has survived a brain tumor resection and a stroke, uses a communication device to stay connected with family, friends, and his community. His current device was outdated, so through the Ability Tools program, he borrowed an Accent 1000 to compare it with his existing Accent 1400. After an extended trial, Joe found he could communicate faster with the smaller Accent 1000 but ultimately felt the Accent 1400 better suited his needs. He is now awaiting insurance approval to receive a new Accent 1400 as his permanent replacement.</p>

Katie contacted the Oregon AT Program’s lending library for mobility equipment for an upcoming trip. Her grandmother and mother were visiting to experience the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, with a highlight being her grandmother’s lifelong dream of seeing the redwoods. To meet her grandmother’s mobility needs, Katie and her mother researched ADA-accessible trails in the area. Katie borrowed a manual wheelchair and a rolling walker with a seat from the lending library to make the trip easier. </p>              

<p class="card-text">The visit was a success, and Katie shared, “Even though I knew the forest was majestic, I was surprised by how deeply it moved my grandmother. She kept thanking us and telling strangers that visiting the redwoods was on her bucket list—and that her daughter and granddaughter had made it happen. Without the lending library, none of this would’ve been possible.”</p>

The admissions officer for the Alabama State Bar Exam contacted Alabama’s Assistive Technology Resource (APTAT). The Bar Office was referred to APTAT by vocational rehabilitation for assistive technology support. Two examinees had requested accommodations, and each visited APTAT to trial devices from our library. One explored mobile standing desks and ergonomic mice; the other tested CCTVs, text-to-speech tools, keyboards, and screen magnification. Each selected a setup tailored to their needs. APTAT delivered and set up the devices at the exam site for their three-day exam. The Bar Office was grateful for the support, and we were proud to contribute to such an important event!</p>

 <p class="card-text"><img src="/assets/Device-Reuse1.png" class="float-left img-fluid" style="padding-right:1em;" alt="Linda in wheelchair">
Ranchers wear boots for a reason—they’re built for the rough terrain of pastureland and cattle corrals. Now, imagine navigating that same ground in a wheelchair. That’s daily life for Bret, who checks fences, feeds cattle, and tags calves using a manual or power wheelchair, an ATV, or a pickup with a lift. After a 2004 accident left him with a spinal cord injury, Bret adapted—but most power wheelchairs aren’t made for rugged ranch work. He’s worn out many wheelchairs, and even with heavy-duty models, tasks like tossing grain, fixing fences, or vaccinating over 150 cattle each season remain physically taxing. That changed when Assistive Technology for Kansans (ATK) provided a used Permobil Corpus M3 power chair with a 12-inch seat elevation.</p>                                                                                       <p class="card-text">Bret immediately saw the benefits. “There’s a fridge right next to the chute with the vaccines,” he said. “Being able to turn on a dime and raise the seat makes a huge difference. I can work more independently, and it’s eased the strain on my shoulders—especially important since I recently found out I have two torn rotator cuffs.”</p>

Eduard, an 8th grader with cerebral palsy receiving outpatient Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) services at the CIDE Assistive Technology Clinic, was a recipient of one of the Assistive Technology Program of Colorado’s open-ended loans. He came to our clinic with a Tobi I5 and eye gaze system but no mount to secure it to his wheelchair, rendering it unusable. Since he wasn't due for a new device for another two years, he was provided with a device mount. Using the mount in conjunction with his Tobi I5 has transformed Eduard's life. He now uses his AAC device regularly and has access to a means of communication at school, at home, and in the community. One of his teacher’s states, “He is a completely different kid and is now interacting with his peers and other teachers.” </p>

Our new partnership to support the administration of the last-resort funding organization, Libby’s Friends, has been a joy to see come to fruition. Libby’s Friends does amazing work—fundraising and working tirelessly to fulfill as many assistive technology requests as their budget allows. One heartwarming story comes from a family who received a folding power chair for their son, Orin. The chair, affectionately named “Noodle,” has given Orin the freedom and independence to explore his world. His mom shared, “We are learning so much more about O’s personality now that he can explore new places at his own pace. He looked at me in amazement the first time we took Noodle out and I told Orin, ‘Go where you want to—I’m right behind you.’ We were at a community festival, and he went straight for the cake tables!” They also report that the chair’s impact is growing, as Orin’s providers are now recommending similar devices to other patients after seeing the positive results.</p>

After trying out a CloverBook recommended by DakotaLink, one student finally received a device of his own—and the difference has been remarkable. Previously, he used a bulky, outdated vision board that was heavy, hard to move, and offered limited features. It became more of a burden than a support, especially as academic demands increased. After an assessment, DakotaLink provided a CloverBook for trial. The student received the CloverBook within one week, and staff helped train the student and his teachers.</p>                                                                   

<p class="card-text">From day one, his classroom engagement and confidence noticeably improved. Now, he can view the front of the classroom and complete written work at the same time. He can track a moving teacher and switch between materials with ease. His independence and participation have increased dramatically. The right technology can be life-changing and this device has transformed his school experience. </p>
