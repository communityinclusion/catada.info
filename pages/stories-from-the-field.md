  <p class="card-text">A Stethoscope Opens Up a Career Path </p>
  <p class="card-text">J is a high school student who has profound deafness. He is pursuing an EMT course through his local community college, and needed a specialized stethoscope in order to hear clearly. J worked with the Nebraska AT Partnership and the AT4ALL website to compare different stethoscopes until he found a ThinkLabs One Digital Stethoscope that was compatible with his cochlear implant. Unfortunately, Nebraska VR was unable to fund the AT equipment recommended. However, through ATP funding coordination, as well as financial contributions from J and his family, J was able to purchase the stethoscope he needed. </p>                                                                                                 <p class="card-text">J plans to become a Certified Emergency Medical Technician. After graduation from high school, he will continue his training to become licensed as a paramedic. His stethoscope will allow him to succeed as he trains for and enters this career.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/MT_Device_Loan_2018.jpg" alt="Obi Eating with AT devices" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p class="card-text">Being fed by his parents at home wasn’t a big deal for Heath. As a fourth grader with cerebral palsy, he was used to it. But being fed at school in front of his peers? “It was just really weird having other people watching me while I was getting fed by an adult,” he explained. </p>              <p class="card-text">MonTECH (Montana’s AT Program) arranged for a trial of Obi, a robotic feeding companion. Heath’s multiple test drives of Obi showed he was able to use Obi to eat independently. Coupled with mom Jenny’s research about the health benefits of self-feeding, the Montgomerys were able to pursue funding for an Obi for Heath.</p>                                                                                         <p class="card-text">Now Heath’s Obi allows him to eat independently at school, at home, and in restaurants. Heath’s classmate confirms the cool factor: “We think it’s just really awesome that Heath can eat by himself without his mom.”</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/NC_device_Reutilization.jpg" alt="reclining wheelchair" class="img-fluid"></p>
  <p class="card-text">In August 2018, 17 months after Hurricane Matthew hit North Carolina, the North Carolina Assistive Technology Program (NCATP) got a call from NC Emergency Management regarding two hurricane survivors needing AT and durable medical equipment. The survivors needed a manual reclining wheelchair, a standing lift, an electric hospital bed, and a lift chair. Both individuals lived in the Roberson County area (a very rural portion of NC). </p>                                                                             <p class="card-text">Frank Harden, NCATP’s reuse coordinator, contacted individuals across the state to locate the items needed. Within hours, he found a gentleman near Raleigh who had recently lost his wife from a lengthy illness. He wanted to donate durable medical equipment to the NCATP reuse program. The items to be donated were exactly the items needed by the two hurricane survivors. </p>                  <p class="card-text">NCATP arranged for pickup and delivery to the survivors, about 2 hours from Raleigh, and within 2 days of the original request, they had all the equipment they needed. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/LA_State_Financing.jpg" alt="Latrisa using magnifier hardware" class="img-fluid">
<p class="card-text">Latrisa, a single mom, became partially blind in January 2017. She learned about the Louisiana Assistive Technology Access Network (LATAN), and became familiar with some assistive devices for vision, including an Amigo HD video magnifier and MAGic Screen Reading and Magnification Software. </p>                                                                                                                                               <p class="card-text">Latrisa was able to use LATAN’s new AT Lease Program to help her to afford the devices she needed to see. She reported that being able to lease the devices allowed her a little freedom, and she was able to get a seasonal job with Amazon because she has this assistive technology. </p>
