  <p class="card-text">North Dakota AT Program staff commented on the proposed renewal of the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid waiver. The AT program requested that the waiver be amended to include AT evaluations under the Specialized Equipment (SE) and Environmental Modifications (EM) portions. The program also requested that the qualifications for those providing AT evaluations under the EM portion be changed.</p>
  <p class="card-text">Due to these efforts, North Dakota Aging Services agreed to amend the HCBS Waiver. The waiver now includes a provision for AT evaluations under SE and EM. In addition, the requirements to be able to provide AT evaluations under the EM provision have changed.
