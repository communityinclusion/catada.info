<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>New Mexico currently has three state financing activities. The New Mexico Technology Assistance Program (NMTAP) <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/financial-loans/access-loan-new-mexico/"> Access Loan </a> Program (Title 1) provides guaranteed loans to individuals with disabilities for assistive technology purchases. The <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/financial-loans/new-mexico-seed-loan-program">SEED Loan</a> (Telework Loan Program) provides guaranteed loans for equipment to persons with disabilities who are entrepreneurs with a home based business. The program is administered by the Technology Loan Council TLC. The AT Community Fund (Last Resort Fund) is a cooperative program between NMTAP and several nonprofit organizations to purchase Assistive Technology (AT) devices for individuals who have no other funding options. NMTAP contracts with a non-profit organization, San Juan Center for Independence, for all of the financial loan programs.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>New Mexico operates a device recycling/repair program that allows individuals with disabilities to participate in educational, employment or community activities. NMTAP provides used medical equipment through <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/device-reutilization/">Back in Use</a> and refurbished computers through the <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/device-reutilization/"> DiverseIT</a> programs. DiverseIT also provides low cost computer repairs or training for individuals with disabilities, including our aging population. NMTAP contracts with a nonprofit organization, Adelante Development Center, for both of these reutilization initiatives.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>New Mexico provides device loans to individuals with disabilities, teachers, therapists, case managers, vocational rehabilitation counselors or other advocates to try out assistive devices/software prior to purchase. Device loans serve primarily as a trial of equipment prior to purchasing, but are accessed also as a temporary replacement of a device in repair, or a short term accommodation allowing independent completion of activities in daily school, work, or home life.  NMTAP provides temporary device loans statewide through two satellite offices and the FedEx mail system. Up-to-date inventory and the required paperwork can be accessed through the <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/device-loans/">NMTAP Device Loan</a> website page.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>New Mexico has many assistive technology devices and software options that assist with vision, hearing, learning disability, cognitive, speech communication, mobility, activities of daily living and computer access challenges. Detailed demonstrations and a hands-on opportunity of several similar devices are provided to individuals with disabilities to decide what may work best for them to independently participate in employment, education or community engagement. Employers, agency staff, families and advocates may be included in the demonstrations to assist the individual with a disability in making an informed choice. NMTAP provides on-site demonstrations around the state to anyone, of any age, of any disability, anywhere in the state. Call us at 505-841-4464 or request a demonstration through our <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/device-demonstrations/">NMTAP Device Demonstration </a> website page to request a demonstration.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>New Mexico conducts training on AT devices and services through a two-day Assistive Technology Conference (ATC), as well as several partial day workshops in rural areas of the state. These events are conducted annually to increase the knowledge of devices and services of individuals with disabilities and related professionals that work with them.  NMTAP also participates in many transition fairs as well as other conferences and events to provide information on their services. They also provide this information directly to individual groups or agencies, often creating on-going working relationships to better serve individuals with disabilities, veterans or our aging population. NMTAP offers organizations or agencies assistance with making their services accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>

<h3>AgrAbility Services</h3>

<p>NMTAP is a partner of the New Mexico AgrAbility Project offering individual and worksite assessments to farmers and ranchers statewide.  This includes recommendations on AT or adapted farming practices that allow continued or increased food production, as well as referrals to many resources.  On-going case-management support is offered to these food producing individuals and families. Training on AT, modified farming techniques or second injury prevention are also offered statewide several times a year. This <a href="http://www.tap.gcd.state.nm.us/agrability/">NMTAP AgrAbility </a> service is currently offered through August 2022 through a grant provided to New Mexico State University by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>Oklahoma ABLE Tech partners with the Oklahoma Assistive Technology Foundation (OkAT) and BancFirst of Stillwater to provide a statewide alternative financing program (AFP) to Oklahomans with disabilities through two lending products: direct loans for all unsecured loans and bank partner loans for all secured or collateralized loans. The AFP offers a low interest rate loan so individuals have the opportunity to acquire needed assistive technology (AT) by borrowing money to purchase devices, equipment, or modifications. ABLE Tech also provides additional programs to assist with the acquisition of AT at no cost to the consumer through private or grant funded activities.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>ABLE Tech’s Reutilization Program uses quality indicators and best practices for safety and procedures to facilitate the exchange and reuse of gently used assistive technology (AT) and durable medical equipment (DME) between Oklahomans. For Exchange: Items are posted on an accessible website either by ABLE Tech staff or individuals around the state who no longer need the equipment. Oklahomans can then view what is available and request specific items. When possible the Reutilization Program retrieves or receives assistive technology and other medical devices (Ex. gauze pads and orthopedic boots as well as power wheelchairs and hospital beds), places them on the online list, and assists Oklahomans in need in obtaining these items. Equipment is either free and stored at Reutilization offices in Oklahoma City, or they are at a very low cost and stored at the homes of those listing the items on the web. For Reuse: ABLE Tech retrieves, repairs, and refurbishes valuable durable medical equipment (DME) that is no longer needed, and reassigns it to Oklahoma residents in need. This program is funded through the Oklahoma Health Care Authority – Oklahoma’s Medicaid agency. Through this partnership, individuals are able to be matched with durable medical equipment that meets their needs, keep the equipment as long as it continues to meet their needs, then return it to the program so that it may be repaired, refurbished, and reassigned to another person in need. To learn more about these programs and to access available AT and DME, go to okabletech.org/reuse.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>ABLE Tech provides short-term loans of AT devices to individuals or entities. The purpose of the loan may be to assist in decision making, to serve as a loaner while the consumer is waiting for device repair or funding, to provide an accommodation on a short-term basis for a time-limited event, for training, self-education or other professional development activities. The ABLE Tech device loan program has over 2,000 devices to borrow through the in-house lending library as well as at various partner locations across the state.  ABLE Tech partners specialize in various AT (including speech/communication, hearing, and vision to name a few) or age/disability-specific categories (Ex.  Those serving infants and toddlers only, pediatrics as a whole, the aging population, and/or those with Alzheimer’s, etc.).</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>The Oregon Statewide Assistive Technology (OSAT) Program is working to increase access to AT devices by providing Cooperative Buy and Layaway Programs. These finance activities make AT more affordable and get devices into the hands of individuals who couldn't otherwise afford it. Purchasing in bulk reduces the cost of many items, allowing the OSAT Program to pass the savings on to consumers, while at the same time maintaining a small inventory of specific devices, making it possible for the consumer to receive AT devices and services in a more timely fashion.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>The program works to improve acquisition of AT devices and durable medical equipment, through device reutilization which includes both device repair and recycling programs and device exchange programs. Pre-owned devices accepted into the Device Repair/Recycling inventory are repaired or refurbished as needed, then offered for sale to consumers as recycled products. Consumers also have the option of purchasing pre-owned products directly from the current owner through OSAT's print and electronic Device Exchange Program.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>Oregon's Statewide AT Program's mission is to increase accessibility and utilization of assistive technology. One avenue to accomplish this is through a Device Loan Library, which allows Oregonians of all ages and all disabilities the opportunity to make informed choices by "test-driving" specific AT devices in their environment prior to making purchasing decisions. An ARRA grant in 2010 has allowed the Program to increase the breadth and depth of devices available in the lending library, as well as the opportunity to partner with a number of Oregon's Independent Living Centers. Through this partnership, individuals are able to have quicker access to a range of AT devices in their communities.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>Empowered consumers make informed decisions. Therefore, the program provides individuals with the opportunity to compare the features and benefits of a particular AT device or category of devices through guided, hands-on device demonstrations with knowledgeable AT specialists. Many individuals conclude the demonstration with a request to access our lending library. Which again, thanks to the ARRA grant, consumers now have better access to more state-of-the art technologies in their communities.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>OSAT offers a variety of training and technical assistance, public awareness, and collaboration activities to educational, employment, human service and social service professionals. These activities increase the success of students transitioning from high school to college or community living, seniors transitioning to nursing homes or other supported living environments, as well as individuals transitioning from nursing homes back to community living. In addition, the website and toll-free 800 line provides free information and referral services to individuals of all ages and disabilities throughout Oregon.</p>
