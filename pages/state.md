<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>Oklahoma ABLE Tech partners with the Oklahoma Assistive Technology Foundation (OkAT) and BancFirst of Stillwater to provide a statewide alternative financing program (AFP) to Oklahomans with disabilities through two lending products: direct loans for all unsecured loans and bank partner loans for all secured or collateralized loans. The AFP offers a low interest rate loan so individuals have the opportunity to acquire needed assistive technology (AT) by borrowing money to purchase devices, equipment, or modifications. ABLE Tech also provides additional programs to assist with the acquisition of AT at no cost to the consumer through private or grant funded activities.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>ABLE Tech’s Reutilization Program uses quality indicators and best practices for safety and procedures to facilitate the exchange and reuse of gently used assistive technology (AT) and durable medical equipment (DME) between Oklahomans. For Exchange: Items are posted on an accessible website either by ABLE Tech staff or individuals around the state who no longer need the equipment. Oklahomans can then view what is available and request specific items. When possible the Reutilization Program retrieves or receives assistive technology and other medical devices (Ex. gauze pads and orthopedic boots as well as power wheelchairs and hospital beds), places them on the online list, and assists Oklahomans in need in obtaining these items. Equipment is either free and stored at Reutilization offices in Oklahoma City, or they are at a very low cost and stored at the homes of those listing the items on the web. For Reuse: ABLE Tech retrieves, repairs, and refurbishes valuable durable medical equipment (DME) that is no longer needed, and reassigns it to Oklahoma residents in need. This program is funded through the Oklahoma Health Care Authority – Oklahoma’s Medicaid agency. Through this partnership, individuals are able to be matched with durable medical equipment that meets their needs, keep the equipment as long as it continues to meet their needs, then return it to the program so that it may be repaired, refurbished, and reassigned to another person in need. To learn more about these programs and to access available AT and DME, go to okabletech.org/reuse.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>ABLE Tech provides short-term loans of AT devices to individuals or entities. The purpose of the loan may be to assist in decision making, to serve as a loaner while the consumer is waiting for device repair or funding, to provide an accommodation on a short-term basis for a time-limited event, for training, self-education or other professional development activities. The ABLE Tech device loan program has over 2,000 devices to borrow through the in-house lending library as well as at various partner locations across the state.

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>The Oregon Statewide Assistive Technology (OSAT) Program is working to increase access to AT devices by providing Cooperative Buy and Layaway Programs. These finance activities make AT more affordable and get devices into the hands of individuals who couldn't otherwise afford it. Purchasing in bulk reduces the cost of many items, allowing the OSAT Program to pass the savings on to consumers, while at the same time maintaining a small inventory of specific devices, making it possible for the consumer to receive AT devices and services in a more timely fashion.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>The program works to improve acquisition of AT devices and durable medical equipment, through device reutilization which includes both device repair and recycling programs and device exchange programs. Pre-owned devices accepted into the Device Repair/Recycling inventory are repaired or refurbished as needed, then offered for sale to consumers as recycled products. Consumers also have the option of purchasing pre-owned products directly from the current owner through OSAT's print and electronic Device Exchange Program.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>Oregon's Statewide AT Program's mission is to increase accessibility and utilization of assistive technology. One avenue to accomplish this is through a Device Loan Library, which allows Oregonians of all ages and all disabilities the opportunity to make informed choices by "test-driving" specific AT devices in their environment prior to making purchasing decisions. An ARRA grant in 2010 has allowed the Program to increase the breadth and depth of devices available in the lending library, as well as the opportunity to partner with a number of Oregon's Independent Living Centers. Through this partnership, individuals are able to have quicker access to a range of AT devices in their communities.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>Empowered consumers make informed decisions. Therefore, the program provides individuals with the opportunity to compare the features and benefits of a particular AT device or category of devices through guided, hands-on device demonstrations with knowledgeable AT specialists. Many individuals conclude the demonstration with a request to access our lending library. Which again, thanks to the ARRA grant, consumers now have better access to more state-of-the art technologies in their communities.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>OSAT offers a variety of training and technical assistance, public awareness, and collaboration activities to educational, employment, human service and social service professionals. These activities increase the success of students transitioning from high school to college or community living, seniors transitioning to nursing homes or other supported living environments, as well as individuals transitioning from nursing homes back to community living. In addition, the website and toll-free 800 line provides free information and referral services to individuals of all ages and disabilities throughout Oregon.</p>

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>VATS claims comparability for state financing activities as the state has the Assistive Technology Loan Fund Authority (ATLFA), an alternative financing program that offers financial loans for purchasing assistive technology.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>VATS oversees and directs both a formal and informal, or "virtual", statewide network of assistive technology reuse programs called the Virginia Reuse Network (VRN). VRN partner programs work collaboratively with network affiliates and VATS to address the durable medical equipment (DME) needs of persons with disabilities. In addition to the formal DME reuse program, the VRN oversees a virtual network. Through this network the VRN facilitates and tracks AT exchanges for a variety of AT generally not included in the formal DME reuse program.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>The device loan program is a collaborative endeavor among VATS, VATS' Regional Sites, the Virginia Department for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and DARS. Through this partnership, VATS provides a variety short term equipment loans at multiple community contact points throughout Virginia. AT loans help individuals make decisions as to appropriate and effective AT and accelerate assistive technology acquisition.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>Through its partnerships with DARS and VATS Regional Sites, VATS provides AT demonstrations. Individuals interested in acquiring AT want to know what kinds of devices are available, what device is best for them, and how it can be obtained. AT demonstrations help individuals with disabilities try out a variety of technology first before purchasing equipment on their own. One-on-one demonstration sessions are provided by professionals who are familiar with the technology. By "trying before buying," individuals are able to make informed decisions as to what AT may work for them.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>In addition to device loans, demonstrations and reuse activities, VATS provides technical assistance, trainings, information and assistance and general public awareness of AT. All of these activities are customized to meet public need and provide strategies and resources for independent living, employment, and education. VATS provides a toll free number to call for information about devices, services and funding for people with disabilities, care providers, case managers, and service providers. VATS offers a program entitled AT@Work, which is a training program operated by VATS with the stated objectives of educating employers and human resource personnel as to how various types of assistive technology can assist in hiring and retaining productive employees who require accommodation(s). Additionally, two of the university-based VATS regional sites offer a transition experience for students with disabilities and their families who are interested in attending college, while the third university-based Regional VATS site offers an array of skill-building classes and camps for students with disabilities utilizing a variety of software, hardware and strategies to accommodate a range of physical and cognitive challenges.</p>
