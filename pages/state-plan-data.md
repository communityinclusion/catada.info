             <p>Lead Agencies/Implementing Entities implement their activities in many ways. Some implement their activities directly using their own staff and resources, others use subcontractors, and others use combinations of both. Remember, the Implementing Entity is considered the Statewide AT Program, not an “other entity.” Indicate how your program conducts this activity using the following rules:</p><p>

            “The Statewide AT Program” means this activity is carried out exclusively by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity working directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources. Regional sites that are staffed by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity are considered part of the Statewide AT Program.
            </p><p>
            “Other Entities” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity does not work directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources and instead uses external organizations only.
            </p><p>
            “Both” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity carries out the activity using its employees and facilities to work directly with consumers and ALSO uses some subcontracts or other agreements with external organizations whose own employees, facilities, and resources are used to work directly with consumers.</p><p>N/A indicates the activity is not conducted</p><p align="center"><a href="#tableDiv">To top</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="table02_next" class="tableChanger" href="http://localhost:4000/state-plan-data.html#table02"> Next table <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></a></p></div><hr />

              <p><strong>"Revolving loan:</strong> A loan that uses Statewide AT Program funds for loans. The AT
        program directly provides the funds that are to be loaned out and retains full control over
        to whom and at what terms the funds are loaned. As loans are repaid, the money is lent out
        again to other AT consumers — that is, the same money “revolves” out to other borrowers
        as earlier borrowers return it to the program."							



        </p><p><strong>"Loan guarantee or insurance program:</strong> The grantee uses its funds to guarantee all or a
        portion of loans for AT. A guaranteed loan is a loan in which the Statewide AT Program
        guarantees that the loan to a consumer is secure and will be repaid, thus increasing the
        lender’s willingness to loan funds."							






        </p><p><strong>"Interest buy-down loan:</strong> A loan in which AT program funds are used to buy down the
        interest rate of a loan. The AT program uses funds to reduce the interest rate that lending
        institutions offer to consumers for loans to purchase AT. The AT program pays the lending
        institution for a portion of the interest on the loan, resulting in lower interest payments for
        the consumer over the long term."			</strong>
