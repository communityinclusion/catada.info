     <p>Lead Agencies/Implementing Entities implement their activities in many ways. Some implement their activities directly using their own staff and resources, others use subcontractors, and others use combinations of both. Remember, the Implementing Entity is considered the Statewide AT Program, not an “other entity.” Indicate how your program conducts this activity using the following rules:</p><p>

    “The Statewide AT Program” means this activity is carried out exclusively by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity working directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources. Regional sites that are staffed by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity are considered part of the Statewide AT Program.
    </p><p>
    “Other Entities” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity does not work directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources and instead uses external organizations only.
    </p><p>
    “Both” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity carries out the activity using its employees and facilities to work directly with consumers and ALSO uses some subcontracts or other agreements with external organizations whose own employees, facilities, and resources are used to work directly with consumers.</p><p>N/A indicates the activity is not conducted</p></div><hr />

       <p><strong>Central:</strong>	Select this if the Statewide AT Program conducts this activity from a single site that houses all employees and resources engaged in the activity. It may be the case that employees or resources travel from this site to other places, but they are based at a single site, and the other places are not established/permanent sites. Sites that simply serve as referral sources or provide minimal assistance to a central location are not considered regional sites.  </p>
    <p><strong>Regional:</strong>		Select this only if the activity is conducted from at least two sites that operate relatively independently without any of them being considered the main site or headquarters (if one of them is considered the headquarters, choose a combination of central location and regional sites instead). Regional sites can be directly managed by the Lead  Agency/Implementing Entity or can be subcontractors. </p>
    <p><strong>Both:</strong>	Select this only if you have a site that is considered the main site or headquarters that houses the majority of employees and resources and regional sites that also have their own employees and resources. For example, if the majority of the devices for your loan program are located in a central inventory along with those responsible for operating the loan program, but independent living centers under subcontract house their own, smaller inventories and have staff assigned to do loans, you would have both a central location and regional sites</p>

    <p>NA indicates that activity is not conducted. </p>
