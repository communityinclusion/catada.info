         <p>Lead Agencies/Implementing Entities implement their activities in many ways. Some implement their activities directly using their own staff and resources, others use subcontractors, and others use combinations of both. Remember, the Implementing Entity is considered the Statewide AT Program, not an “other entity.” Indicate how your program conducts this activity using the following rules:</p><p>

        “The Statewide AT Program” means this activity is carried out exclusively by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity working directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources. Regional sites that are staffed by employees of the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity are considered part of the Statewide AT Program.
        </p><p>
        “Other Entities” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity does not work directly with consumers using Lead Agency/Implementing Entity facilities and resources and instead uses external organizations only.
        </p><p>
        “Both” means the Lead Agency/Implementing Entity carries out the activity using its employees and facilities to work directly with consumers and ALSO uses some subcontracts or other agreements with external organizations whose own employees, facilities, and resources are used to work directly with consumers.</p><p>N/A indicates the activity is not conducted</p></div><hr />

           <p><strong>Central:</strong>	Select this if the Statewide AT Program conducts this activity from a single site that houses all employees and resources engaged in the activity. It may be the case that employees or resources travel from this site to other places, but they are based at a single site, and the other places are not established/permanent sites. Sites that simply serve as referral sources or provide minimal assistance to a central location are not considered regional sites.  </p>
        <p><strong>Regional:</strong>		Select this only if the activity is conducted from at least two sites that operate relatively independently without any of them being considered the main site or headquarters (if one of them is considered the headquarters, choose a combination of central location and regional sites instead). Regional sites can be directly managed by the Lead  Agency/Implementing Entity or can be subcontractors. </p>
        <p><strong>Both:</strong>	Select this only if you have a site that is considered the main site or headquarters that houses the majority of employees and resources and regional sites that also have their own employees and resources. For example, if the majority of the devices for your loan program are located in a central inventory along with those responsible for operating the loan program, but independent living centers under subcontract house their own, smaller inventories and have staff assigned to do loans, you would have both a central location and regional sites</p>

          <p><strong>"Revolving loan:</strong> A loan that uses Statewide AT Program funds for loans. The AT
    program directly provides the funds that are to be loaned out and retains full control over
    to whom and at what terms the funds are loaned. As loans are repaid, the money is lent out
    again to other AT consumers — that is, the same money “revolves” out to other borrowers
    as earlier borrowers return it to the program."							



    </p><p><strong>"Loan guarantee or insurance program:</strong> The grantee uses its funds to guarantee all or a
    portion of loans for AT. A guaranteed loan is a loan in which the Statewide AT Program
    guarantees that the loan to a consumer is secure and will be repaid, thus increasing the
    lender’s willingness to loan funds."							






    </p><p><strong>"Interest buy-down loan:</strong> A loan in which AT program funds are used to buy down the
    interest rate of a loan. The AT program uses funds to reduce the interest rate that lending
    institutions offer to consumers for loans to purchase AT. The AT program pays the lending
    institution for a portion of the interest on the loan, resulting in lower interest payments for
    the consumer over the long term."			</strong>

(This is not the federally funded NDBEDP or iCanConnect). States may not use AT Act dollars to provide funds or devices directly to individuals. AT Act dollars may be used to administer a telecommunications distribution program comprising non-AT Act dollars.

AT Act dollars may be used to administer a telecommunications distribution program comprising non-AT Act dollars.

        </p><p><strong>Last Resort Fund:</strong> These programs provide AT, or funds to purchase AT, to consumers when other options have been exhausted or are unavailable. These may be earmarked for particular types of consumers (such as children) or particular types of AT (such as home modification) or they may be for any group or type of AT. States may not use AT Act dollars to provide funds or devices directly to individuals. AT Act dollars may be used to administer a last resort fund comprised of non-AT Act dollars.

        </p><p><strong>Home Modification Program:</strong> A home modification program provides home modifications, including the addition of wheelchair ramps.
