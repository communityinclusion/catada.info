  <p class="card-text">Over this past year, Assistive Technology Program of Colorado (ATP) has worked tirelessly in meetings with the state’s Department of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) to establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding shared responsibilities and priorities around AT. The AT Program and the DVR have a renewed formal relationship and will work together to offer education to DVR counselors. The AT Program has already received increased referrals for clients needing AT assessments and device demonstrations as well as requests for training.</p>
  <p class="card-text">The MOU outlines the process of referral for AT services and the responsibilities of both agencies to provide information and resources around AT with regard to device demonstrations, device loans, alternate financing, training, technical assistance, and information and referral. DVR will continue to serve on the AT Coalition, sit on the advisory board for the Colorado Technology Act Program, and collaborate with the AT Program.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
  <p class="card-text">The Illinois Assistive Technology Program (IATP) introduced legislation to address how AT is incorporated into students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). One bill requires that parents and guardians of students with IEPs will be informed about the availability of AT. If the IEP team determines the student does not need AT, parents will be given notification in writing of why that determination was made. They will also be given information about the IATP, including contact information. Additionally, the Illinois State Board of Education is developing guidance on how local districts can record unsuccessful AT trials in the IEP to inform future trials and exploration and support quality AT considerations.</p>

  <p class="card-text">Due to demographic shifts, the Florida AT program adjusted its service delivery model to focus more on delivering services to an aging population. The staff developed senior kits for each Regional Demonstration Center to provide device loans, demonstrations, trainings, and public awareness activities. A wide range of devices are included in the kit, such as rescue and locate devices, home automation units, medication reminders, and simple vehicle modifications.</p>
