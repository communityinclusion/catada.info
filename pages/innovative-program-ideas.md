  <p class="card-text">California’s Public Safety Power Shutoff events in October 2019, 10 Independent Living Centers received over 800 calls urgently requesting power for oxygen equipment, CPAP/BiPAP machines, and power wheelchairs. The California Foundation for Independent Living Centers (CFILC) collaborated with Pacific Gas and Electric to assist people with disabilities and older adults before, during, and after an emergency. Through many of the Independent Living Centers and several community partners, CFILC launched a pilot disaster readiness program, Disability Disaster Access & Resources. This program assists those who use electrical medical devices to access backup portable batteries and charging stations in their region.</p>

Staff from the AT Program reviewed the Occupational Therapy Association’s position and guidelines on tele-health service delivery and obtained state Medicaid contacts in rural states with a similar population distribution. This information was shared with the KHPA contacts. A tele-health practice policy and guidelines were developed and adopted by the state legislature in the 2018–2019 session.</p>
