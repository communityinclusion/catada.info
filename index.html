<h2>ABOUT CATADA</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/catada-icon.png" alt="CATADA Icon" align="right" width="100"/>State and Territory Assistive Technology Programs focus on improving the provision of Assistive Technology (AT) through comprehensive, statewide programs that are consumer responsive. The goal of these programs is to increase access to and acquisition of AT. Programs serve people with all types of disabilities, of all ages, in all environments.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS AT?</h3>
<p>AT is any item, piece of equipment, or system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is commonly used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<h3>AT SERVICES FLOW</h3>
<p>How do you access information about and acquire assistive technology devices for yourself, family members, or clients to enhance life, work, and play? The AT Act authorizes state leadership and state level activities designed to provide an integrated continuum of AT services. Each activity within the continuum provides critical access or acquisition to AT.</p>
