<h2><span>ABOUT CATADA</span></h2>
<p><img src="/assets/catada-icon.png" alt="CATADA Icon" align="right" width="100"/>CATADA is a central hub for data, best practices, consumer stories, and resources focused on improving access to assistive technology (AT) as reported by State and Territory Assistive Technology Programs. The AT Act requires these programs report data annually in a State Plan for AT and Annual Performance Report. CATADA serves as a repository for this data to support program planning and reporting to Congress, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other stakeholders, along with real-life stories showcasing the impact of AT programs.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS AT?</h3>
<p>Assistive technology (AT) plays a vital role in supporting independence for people with disabilities. It includes any device, equipment, or system—commercial, modified, or custom-made—used to enhance functional abilities of people with disabilities.</p>
