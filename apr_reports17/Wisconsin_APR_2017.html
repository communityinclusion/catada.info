Over the years they purchased gait belts, a power wheelchair, a scooter, and reaching devices from the Mobility Store. Debbie said that the two of them were so pleased with the Mobility Store because “They always had what they were looking for before their trip”. Recently, Debbie came in and told staff that Gene had passed away and she wanted to donate all of his items back to the Mobility Store so that they can be used by and make others happy as they did her and her husband.</p>

                <p id="dlanecdote">A consumer came to Options for Independent Living (Options) to receive a demonstration of a TTY for Hearing Carry-Over. The consumer lost his ability to speak three years ago due to throat cancer, and he wanted to be able to make phone calls, since his wife recently began to experience severe hearing loss. When asked about daily, in-person conversations, he stated that he uses a pen and paper to communicate, as his physician told him that an artificial larynx would not work for him. He was unaware of speech-generating devices and nobody had ever mentioned Augmentative and Alternative Communication Devices. Options provided information on advanced systems (which are high-cost and require specialization) as well as simple, low-cost solutions, of which he had much more interest in pursuing. He already had an iPad and laptop, which he didn’t use often, but was comfortable using. After trying a few free apps and a demonstration of alternative keyboards, he found a keyboard that made him feel like he had a voice again. The consumer left the office with an excellent solution to a communication barrier, which he had given up finding a solution to years ago, at no cost to him. He borrowed a few of the assistive technology devices that were demonstrated and was planning to use his “new voice” for the telephone and for everyday in-person conversations. He also borrowed a personal amplifier for his wife to try so that she may be able to better hear his “new voice.”</p>

                <p id="dmanecdote">Center for Independent Living Western Wisconsin recently received a referral of an individual who was looking for a magnifying floor lamp. During the initial appointment, she was extremely concerned about the price of a lamp and didn’t want to buy something without knowing if it would meet her needs. The assistive technology specialist at the Independent Living Center was able to demonstrate two different magnifying floor lamps for her. She was very excited to try them out before deciding to purchase one. She was also very surprised that the magnifying floor lamps that were demonstrated were relatively inexpensive, compared to what she anticipated they would cost.  She was very grateful for the information. After trying out the lamps, she decided on the magnifying lamp she wanted to purchase and the Independent Living Center was able to loan one to her until her new lamp arrived.</p>

                <h4>B. Description of Training Activities</h4>
                <p>Describe innovative one high-impact assistance training activity conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB1">The Lead Agency sponsored the Across the Lifespan Conference (an assistive technology conference) which was held in November 2016 and attended by 150 participants from Independent Living Centers, institutions of higher learning, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, Department of Public Instruction, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and other stakeholders. Additionally, the Lead Agency held three regional trainings which focused on a specific use of Assistive Technology and/or AT and applications for specific populations. At these trainings, we also had presenters from other State Assistive Technology Programs or experts share best practices such as assessment, collaboration, and application development.  The three trainings were: The Role of Assistive Technology in Emergency Preparedness held on June 27, 2017; A Finer Focus: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the use of Assistive Technology held on July 27, 2017; and Bridging the Communication Gap: Assistive Technology Devices and Services for People Who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing held on September 15, 2017. Ninety-seven percent of training participants felt the topics covered at these trainings were relevant to them. The highest ranked regional training was the one held in September. Some of the feedback received included:

•	I liked the specificity of the topic-well defined allowed for in-depth training;
•	Well rounded information, there was information that gave more detail RE deaf/blind.
•	The breadth and scope overview of these topics was incredibly beneficial.
•	The AT discussions and demonstrations was the highlight for me b/c I'm trying to gain more knowledge about options specifically for consumers w/hearing loss.
•	Very educated trainers, new info to me even after more than a decade.
•	 The focus on the specific population of people with hearing loss was great considering we work with many in that population.
•	Everything was great, I especially like the parent support programs because the trainers provided insight about the programs provided to the parents and the children, I also liked the many technologies discussed in training because I found the devices to be helpful to me to understand new resources I can provide a consumer down the road; It was helpful to know that there are resources and providers throughout WI that will travel to consumers.
•	I liked that you picked a subject and dealt with it from a variety of perspectives.</p>
                <p>Breifly describe one training activity related to transition conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB2">A three-day Accessibility Survey Academy Project (ASAP) training was held in August 2017 (2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design-based training) and covered the basics of accessibility surveying. The training was open to WisTech subcontractors (Wisconsin’s eight Independent Living Centers). During the training, participants learned about surveying practices, methods, and measurement techniques that are common throughout various referenced Accessibility Standards, whether they are Federal, State or local.  One requirement may be more stringent than another, but the way the measurements are taken, the data collected, and the report delivered are the same for whatever law the survey is performed under. Training participants also received hands-on training using the survey tools and learned about common recommendations for removing barriers to program access in facilities. This allows each ILC to now have certified staff in surveying. This will be helpful in transition activities as ILCs can now assess both business and school settings for youth transitioning to employment or postsecondary education  and  make recommendations both related to assistive technology and the environment that would make it more accessible for the consumer. Additionally, ILCs can do home modification assessments and provide specific recommendations both related to assistive technology and the home that would make the home/apartment more accessible. This can assist individuals with disabilities transitioning from an institution to a community setting of their choice to assess what is needed to successfully make that transition; these services can also be beneficial to a person with a disability wanting to remain in their home.</p>
                <p id="trB3Head">Breifly describe one training activity related to Information and Communication Technology accessibility:</p>
                <p id="trB3">At the Across the Lifespan conference ICT training was provided, specifically a workshop titled, "The digital classroom, serving literacy needs on multiple technology platforms." In addition, the AT Advisory Council and Lead Agency have been focusing on ICT from the perspective of making all WisTech materials including AT Advisory Council member applications, AT Council Advisory meeting materials, WisTech web page on DHS website, WisTech logo (new logo can be seen by individuals with low-vision and who are color blind), and marketing materials accessible according to 508 standards and with JAWS and other AT programs. There has been an additional focus on ensuring all meetings are accessible to AT Advisory Council members and all stakeholders who wanted to attend AT Advisory Council Meetings and when working on the State Plan. Specifically, in addition to holding meetings at locations that were accessible to people with physical disabilities, the meetings were also made available via teleconference and Skype which allowed for people with various disabilities to participate. For example, send the meeting materials in PDFs before the meetings allowed a low-vision participant to participate in the meetings more effectively as they could read the meeting materials. Additionally, having Skype allowed a person with disability who could not verbalize to provide feedback to the AT Advisory Council by typing in the message bar. Despite trying to make these meetings accessible, the Lead Agency found that by converting the State Plan from Word to a PDF that it was not reading correctly with JAWS, despite accessibility measures being taken as the Council used track changes. We are using this as a learning opportunity, and are now going to have a training for the AT Advisory Council, Independent Living Centers, and other stakeholders on how to design Word documents more effectively and other ways to work on documents collaboratively in the future while ensuring accessibility for all.</p>

                <h4>B. Description of Technical Assistance</h4>
                <p>Describe Innovative one high-impact assistance activity that is not related to transition:</p>
                <p id="taB1">IndependenceFIrst worked with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) to prepare and issue a survey on public building accessibility. The ILC recruited and distributed the survey to 21 Beta Testers. UWM will be using the results of this test to begin building an accessibility database of local buildings. Their goal is get funding for a nationwide distribution and to create a national resource on building access that would be available to people with disabilities across the country.

The Lead Agency is working with the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, AT staff and Department of Public Instruction, Special Education leadership to create informatics which outline what AT services and devices are available to consumers and what resources are available to pay for them, and eligibility if applicable. We meet on a monthly basis and hope to having a training for DVR, DPI, and DHS staff along with ILCs, ADRCs, and other stakeholders in the near future so everyone has this information.</p>
                <p>Breifly describe one technical assistance activity related to transition conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="taB2">UWM is engaged in a project called HESTIA, which involves developing an app that therapists can use to do home assessments. IndependenceFirst participate in the advisory group, which meets quarterly. ILC staff have continued to work with them on developing and refining the app. Once complete this project can assist individuals transitioning from a medical or institutional setting back to their homes or a community setting of their choice for the first time. It would allow them to plan for what home modifications will be needed to move back to a home environment. The project is due to be completed in 2018.

                <p id="Narrative1">1. IndependenceFirst regularly provides training to medical students. In the fall, they where holding a training for physicians in training from the Medical College on Disability Awareness and assistive technology. On this training day, the agency was also hosting the Governor appointed Wisconsin Council on Physical Disabilities quarterly meeting. During the panel for medical students which has individuals with disabilities share what they wish doctors knew about working with people with disabilities, CPD members as well as ILC staff jointly presented to the medical college students. CPD members also demonstrated some AT devices.</p>
                <p id="Narrative2">2. At the Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the Deaf and hard of hearing Outreach Professional and Family Conference the Lead Agency, an ILC, and the Mobility Store each had a booth and presented to families with Deaf-blind children resources and services we could provide to children. Many did not realize the program could serve children. We raised a lot of awareness about the WisTech program and the Mobility Store. Many families were grateful to learn about the discounted mobility devices as Deaf-blind children are often behind in their mobility skills due to the nature of their other disabilities being sensory.</p>

            <p id="leveragedFundingIssues">DHS became the permanent entity for the National Deaf-Blind Distribution Program, administered by the FCC, which provides individuals with significant vision and hearing loss with free telecommunications equipment and training. The state funding was secured from the Public Service Commission, which awarded the Independent Living Centers with a $350,000 annual budget line item in the Universal Service Fund to provide telecommunications outreach, training, and equipment to individuals with disabilities statewide. Both of these programs were not implemented for the full federal fiscal year. Both of these programs run from July 1 - June 30 on a State Fiscal Year. These programs both provide demonstration, training, and funds to purchase equipment for consumers.</p>
