<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>The Oregon Statewide Assistive Technology (OSAT) Program is working to increase access to AT devices by providing Cooperative Buy and Layaway Programs. These finance activities make AT more affordable and get devices into the hands of individuals who couldn't otherwise afford it. Purchasing in bulk reduces the cost of many items, allowing the OSAT Program to pass the savings on to consumers, while at the same time maintaining a small inventory of specific devices, making it possible for the consumer to receive AT devices and services in a more timely fashion.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>The program works to improve acquisition of AT devices and durable medical equipment, through device reutilization which includes both device repair and recycling programs and device exchange programs. Pre-owned devices accepted into the Device Repair/Recycling inventory are repaired or refurbished as needed, then offered for sale to consumers as recycled products. Consumers also have the option of purchasing pre-owned products directly from the current owner through OSAT's print and electronic Device Exchange Program.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>Oregon's Statewide AT Program's mission is to increase accessibility and utilization of assistive technology. One avenue to accomplish this is through a Device Loan Library, which allows Oregonians of all ages and all disabilities the opportunity to make informed choices by "test-driving" specific AT devices in their environment prior to making purchasing decisions. An ARRA grant in 2010 has allowed the Program to increase the breadth and depth of devices available in the lending library, as well as the opportunity to partner with a number of Oregon's Independent Living Centers. Through this partnership, individuals are able to have quicker access to a range of AT devices in their communities.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>Empowered consumers make informed decisions. Therefore, the program provides individuals with the opportunity to compare the features and benefits of a particular AT device or category of devices through guided, hands-on device demonstrations with knowledgeable AT specialists. Many individuals conclude the demonstration with a request to access our lending library. Which again, thanks to the ARRA grant, consumers now have better access to more state-of-the art technologies in their communities.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>OSAT offers a variety of training and technical assistance, public awareness, and collaboration activities to educational, employment, human service and social service professionals. These activities increase the success of students transitioning from high school to college or community living, seniors transitioning to nursing homes or other supported living environments, as well as individuals transitioning from nursing homes back to community living. In addition, the website and toll-free 800 line provides free information and referral services to individuals of all ages and disabilities throughout Oregon.</p>

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>WVATS claims flexibility for state financing activities.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>WVATS facilitates exchange of assistive devices through its Virtual Loan Library and Exchange system. This system is available online for individuals to post the availability of devices and to look for used devices. In addition, WVATS contracts with two device exchange and reutilization programs that already exist in the state. These include the Arc of the Mid-Ohio Valley and the Northern West Virginia Center for Independent Living.</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>WVATS operates a statewide assistive technology device loan program that provides short-term loans (30 days) to individuals with disabilities, their families and professionals. This allows individuals to ‘try before they buy’ assistive devices. The WVATS Virtual Loan Library includes a listing of over 5000 devices available around the state from ten different partners.</p>

<h3>Device Demonstration</h3>

<p>WVATS supports a large demonstration center in Morgantown and smaller centers around the state that serve all ages and differing needs. Staff includes users of assistive technology and family members of users. WVATS provides specific AT device demonstrations in collaboration with vendors throughout the state.</p>

<h3>State Leadership Activities</h3>

<p>WVATS offers technical assistance to state agencies regarding accessibility issues. WVATS has created specialized curricula and offers trainings and workshops on assistive technology to diverse audiences of consumers, family members and service providers. WVATS is a West Virginia 211 affiliate, providing training and resources about assistive technology. WVATS provides information and assistance to individuals, families and professionals through its toll-free hotline, e-mail and walk-ins.</p>

<h3>State Financing Activities</h3>

<p>Wisconsin is claiming comparability due to the existence of WisLoan, an alternative financing program that is operated by Independence First, a community-based organization.</p>

<h3>Device Reutilization</h3>

<p>WisTech coordinates existing statewide device reutilization programs. The largest program is the Independence First Mobility Store. IF Mobility serves as a model in the state in terms of its established services of collection repair, refurbishment and redistribution of equipment to consumers. The repair and refurbishment activities are performed in collaboration with the Department of Corrections prison industry program. Device Reutilization also occurs through device exchanges, which primarily take place through the Independent Living Centers</p>

<h3>Device Loan</h3>

<p>WisTech operates device loan centers through Wisconsin's network of Independent Living Centers (ILCs). The ILCs serve the statewide population to provide a single point of entry and access to loan programs for all residents of the state. There are eight ILCs providing these services as part of the WisTech Network of Device Loan and Device Demonstration centers. The WisTech implementing agency, the Stout Vocational Rehabilitation Institute (SVRI) also maintains a device loan program. A Web-based inventory allows individuals to access a list of the equipment available for loan and demonstration through WisTech: <a href="https://www.wisconsinat4all.com/welcome.aspx">https://www.wisconsinat4all.com/welcome.aspx</a>.</p>
