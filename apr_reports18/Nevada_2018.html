                <p id="sfanecdote1">AFP-CARE Loan:  We have consumers with a child with mobility barriers which also mean there are barriers to transportation.  The parents are both school teachers, and recently applied for a loan to purchase a modified van for their child.  Just 2 years before we were unable to help them with home equity lending they were seeking for home access modifications that were already in progress.  Fortunately, this time we were able to help facilitate the loan to purchase a modified vehicle at significant savings.  What was also unique is that the vehicle that the family decided to purchase was from another CARE Loan Fund consumer that no longer needed the vehicle.  The resale, and reuse, of the vehicle will result both significant savings for the new owners as well as provided the resources for previous owner to pay off their loan.</p>

                <p id="sfanecdote2">AT/IL Program (Last Resort):  Consumer J’s wife contacted the program following a significant life changing disability that her husband had experienced.  He was currently in a hospital for an extended period with an expectation that he would be transferred to care facility following the medical services.  James knew he wanted to return home and a plan began to evolve.  Goals were developed as part of the plan to transition home.  The first barrier was his personal mobility where a power wheelchair was needed, and it had to be set up so that he could independently operate it as well as had the proper seating for his needs.   To address the barriers of the home a ramp was built, multiple doors were widened, bathroom modifications including a roll-in shower, and rolling shower/commode chair was also provided.  While an alternative resource was available for his mobility device and state program resources were necessary for all solutions to address the barriers of returning home.  The consumer was able to transition home.  From the time of contacting the program till confirmation that he goals were met it was just short of a year and a half.   There was one additonal goal that was withdrawn that is anticipated to be established again once he is ready.  The cost of AT solutions to fulfill his wish to come home is comparable to 2 months in a care facility.  Over his lifetime his choice to live at home and in his community will likely save millions of Medicaid institution dollars.   </p>

NATC community partners maintained two refurbish/repair/recycle programs in the two largest populated areas within the state.  By leveraging state funds we have been able to provide community partners with funding to pay for parts and repairs to various AT that comes in.  All consumers accessing the AT/IL program are encouraged to donate AT that is not needed and to list the AT on the Nevada Assistive Technology Exchange (NATE).  </p>

                <p id="dmanecdote">NATC’s community partner Easterseals Nevada and the Assistive Technology Independent Living Program had the pleasure of working with a young consumer M who is completely nonverbal.  The AT that M had was no longer suited nor did it met his needs.  His mother first sought help through her “tech” church goers and when that was unsuccessful, she reached out to BestBuy still with no success. M’s goal was to grant him the ability to effectively communicate with his mother and the outside world.  Through the NATC programs at Easterseals Nevada he was provided in-depth technical assistance for potential solutions, options, and vendors.  After numerous device demonstrations an AT solution was selected. The identified communication device is described as M’s communication savior.  Providing him the tool needed to effectively communicate with his mother and the world. He now enjoys communicating with his family and friends.  Both M and his mother are very happy with the results as his life has improved greatly with the use of his communication device.</p>

                <p>Describe innovative one high-impact assistance training activity conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB1">NATC partner UNR’s AT Resource Center coordinated a highly innovative training activity and collaboration with Apple. The training was for both Apple and individuals with vision loss, and developed to explore how people with blindness or vision loss could participate in playgrounds involving coding. 6 people who are blind or vision impaired navigated to the Apple Store in Reno, Nevada. Apple staff introduced them to Swift, a powerful programming language created by Apple and used by the pros to build today’s most popular apps. It was successful in a couple ways. First it exposed the Apple Store staff to 6 users of the Voice Over screen reader tool and its functional use in the Swift Playground. Second it trained the Blind user on coding and sparked interest from the group to continue to explore coding as a hobby.</p>
                <p>Breifly describe one training activity related to transition conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB2">NATC partner Easterseals Nevada has maintained a long-standing relationship with the Blind Center of Nevada.  Providing multiple device demonstrations monthly and throughout the year.  This year the Blind Center began a cooking program bringing in a professional chef to lead the program. Faced with several challenges by individuals in the program an extensive technical assistance was provided to bridge the gap between the knowledgeable chef and teaching a cooking program to persons with disabilities.  Most importantly to consumers that require and will be using AT to complete the class.  After providing technical assistance and consultation the team was able to outfit the kitchen with talking scales, finger guards for using knives, a PenFriend to identify objects within the kitchen, and a talking thermometer to identify the temperature of items. Through this collaboration, the Blind Center has been able to successfully implement its cooking program with numerous individuals finding success, including these individuals cooking the daily lunches for the rest of the center.</p>
                <p id="trB3Head">Breifly describe one training activity related to Information and Communication Technology accessibility:</p>
                <p id="trB3">Through the Visually Impaired User Group training was provided to individuals regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act, the AT Act and other relevant civil rights legislation regarding websites, and access to accessible documents and technology. Participants discussed information on the laws and how it impacted the topic area. The group developed strategies to address the barriers and what characteristics an accessible document must have. From this training members and participants were able to move forward with systems change within several State and local government agencies that they were interacting with. The group reported back about their interactions and that the training received was helpful in the overall process of integrating their accessible technologies into the services they were requesting.</p>

                <p id="taB1">During the period of performance the project continued its collaboration with the DD ACT partners which include the Nevada Center for Excellence in DD/NATRC, the Governors Council on DD, and the Nevada Disability Advocacy and Law Center. These partners received on-going technical assistance from the Nevada AT Collaborative in order to establish necessary policies and procedures to improve services regarding accessible information and communication technologies. The project developed materials and a curriculum which lead to a series of trainings, some of which are continuing. It advised on program planning, funding opportunities and how to incorporate the agreed upon strategies into the agencies’ 5 year plan. As a result there have been videos developed and more and more agencies in the state are working toward improving access to accessible technologies.</p>

                <p id="taB2">NATC partner Easterseals Nevada worked with B who was facing challenges in the work place and maintaining employment.  B had worked in facilities for decades including helping to open several prominent casinos on The Strip and Downtown. Due to a disease B had was not able to access his computer as he would often type the incorrect key or be unable to select the icon on the computer screen due to tremors. He also faced challenges in meetings as recording notes and information was nearly impossible due to his inability to write legibly or type on the computer.   In coordination with Easterseals Nevada, B was able to be outfitted with several devices to help him overcome his work place challenges. These devices included a keyboard which had enlarged key sizes so that finding his desired key was an easier task; a mouse with a trackball so that he could use his “good” thumb to navigate the computer screen; a finger print scanner which allowed him to quickly unlock his computer; as well as a</p>

                <p id="Narrative1">1. NATC partner Easterseals Nevada, NV Disability Advocacy and Law Center (Nevada’s PAAT), and United Way provided a significant outreach to the Hispanic community to demonstrate what assistive technology is, what devices are available, how to access the devices in schools, employment, and community living.  The main focus was on school age children and how to access services through the school district.  NATEproject was discussed as a resource to demonstrate and trial devices to educate and provide information to the parent when discussing their child’s needs.  This event was presented at three different community centers in the community and proved to be a significant public awareness event.</p>
                <p id="Narrative2">2. NATC partner UNR’s NV AT Resource Center participated in a collaborative effort with the University of Nevada, Reno, local school districts, and the Department of Education. Over 150 k-12 students with disabilities and some parents and staff attended. Information and resources were provided in this public forum as well as several devices and products available for demonstration. Having current and accessible technology services and resources available created an enthusiastic fervor with the young adults and further engagement with some of the participants was established. Many of the students were exposed to AT for the first time, and some in various ways were already using AT as part of their daily routine at school and in the community. It was an opportunity to showcase the most current devices and products that were available to them. There was feedback received that indicated the need for a better way to assist the community in navigating resources that seem to be Silo’s in some areas of the State.</p>
