                <p id="sfanecdote1">Jose and Sophia applied to the Financial Loan Program in hopes of being able to support their brother with his mobility needs. They were in a desperate search for a way to get a stair lift in their home, as they could no longer help their brother up and down a flight of stairs. In fear of having to move as a result of their daily struggles, they searched for a way to be able to afford the expensive adaptation to their home. The three siblings found a company to assess their home and provide them with a detailed estimate for the purchase and installation of the lift. They were able to use this for the loan application, which was approved. As a result, Jose and Sophia were able to provide their brother with a lift in their home, allowing them all to stay in their home and giving their brother the independence to move around at his own leisure. </p>

                <p id="sfanecdote2">Barbara is 55 years old and lives in an elderly housing community as a result of her multiple disabilities.  A presentation was given by AT Loan staff at Barbara’s housing complex, which she was initially hesitant to attend, but was encouraged by the housing coordinator to be a part of.  After the presentation, Barbara confided in the AT Loan staff about her long history of hospital stays and medical treatments that had left her with significant memory loss.  She hoped that the staff could help her find technology that could give her daily reminders for important tasks, such as medication reminders. After the program staff demonstrated various items such as the Amazon Echo and the Google Home and their features, Barbara decided that the Amazon Echo could be a good fit for her, especially with its many other functions other than reminders.  Barbara applied for and was approved for a loan, which she used to purchase an Amazon Echo.  It was set-up in Barbara’s home and she has been doing very well with it.  Barbara is grateful for the support the device has given her.  Not only does it give her daily reminders for medications, but it has reduced her stress and anxiety as well.  She has also started to explore the other functions that the Echo offers and states that it makes her feel less alone in her apartment.</p>

She reported that she was only able to run errands with the assistance of another person because of her gait and feeling unsteady. Her insurance would not cover a rollator and she was on a fixed income and couldn’t afford to buy one. After receiving a rollator walker donated through a donation drive held by REquipment and UCP she reported, “Now I can go out by myself and do errands. I can actually go out for walks now too, and get some much needed exercise.” “It has literally given me my independence back.”</p>

                <p id="dlanecdote">Susan K. is a massage therapist and she often needs to read the latest articles in her field.  Susan has light sensitivity and visual impairment due to Albinism, but most of these articles are not available in alternative format.  Because of her visual impairment, reading visually is fatiguing and difficult for her.  She usually takes many breaks to rest her eyes. 
When Susan heard about the ATRC and the hundreds of devices they have available to borrow for free, she decided to try it out. She went to the center to learn about devices that would not only help her see text larger but would also read text back to her when her eyes felt tired.  After being shown a couple of devices, she settled on the Optelec ClearView+ due to the features that the device offers.    This device allows the user to see the text in many different sizes, colors and has the added feature of reading the text out loud with a selection of various electronic voices.  With this device Susan found that she can simply enlarge the text to a comfortable level and when her eyes tire she can switch to having the text read back to her at a comfortable speed and voice.  She enjoys the option of both reading visually and sitting back and listening to the text.  Also, she can adjust the volume and speed of the reader to a comfortable level.  Since she borrowed the device, she has obtained one of her own which she uses frequently for all kinds of daily tasks as well as for her job.</p>

                <p id="dmanecdote">Mrs. B has a physical disability which makes it difficult to re-position herself in bed at night.  She called the ATRC in Pittsfield to find out if they had a device that can be of use.  She had recently heard about the Weight and Seating Independence Project which provides accessible wheelchair scales and pressure mapping technology to the public. Mrs. B told ATRC staff she sleeps in the same position every night on her shoulder and that she often wondered if it would be a problem or cause any issues.  

The ATRC staff demonstrated two different pressure mapping systems available for borrowing to Mrs. B; both included pads for mapping seating and for mapping positioning in bed.  Following the demonstration, Mrs. B decided one system looked easier for her to use, and borrowed it to use at home.   When she returned it she reported that she was so happy and relieved to find out that she wasn’t having any pressure issues during sleep.  Before the mapping session she had been questioning if she needed a new mattress.  She liked that she could save and e mail the results to her doctor if she needed to.  She really liked to be able to see on the screen what was going on and to get immediate feedback on her positioning.  Overall the consumer reported that she was very happy to have access to the pressure mapping technology and that it has  made a huge difference in her quality of life.</p>

                <h4>B. Description of Training Activities</h4>
                <p>Describe innovative one high-impact assistance training activity conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB1">In Fy18, MassMATCH hosted a high impact training on the use of Pressure Mapping Technology for the staff of the Tewksbury State Hospital.  The training was conducted by Mary Jo Wagner, OTR/L, ATP who works for the state Dept. of Developmental Services.  The content was developed following an initial set of trainings conducted under the Weight and Seating Independence Project, funded by the Reeves Foundation in 2017, which has since been extended statewide.
A total of 15 medical and other professionals from within the hospital attended the training. The topics covered included issues to consider when working with individuals with all forms of paralyses, where to find potentially useful equipment, and where to find additional resources. This 1.5 hour training was very hands-on and allowed participants to try out pressure mapping technology systems. All the participants stated that it gave them a better appreciation of the issues people with paralysis have to deal with. The content of the training is being further refined so that it can be offered online via webinar to the general public sometime in the spring of 2019.</p>
                <p>Breifly describe one training activity related to transition conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="trB2">During FY18, MassMATCH staff again collaborated with our partners at the MA Executive Office of Elder Affairs (EOEA) to develop and host a series of 9 assistive technology trainings across the state. These were all advanced trainings and followed another training series we hosted in FY17.  The curriculum of the new trainings was revised based on feedback received from the year before.
All 9 trainings were considered Advanced and provided a detailed exploration of the use of the Transition Assistance to Community Living Environment (TACLE) assessment tool.  This simple tool, developed under MassMATCH, was designed for use with individuals who are planning to move from institutions into the community, and helps consumers and professionals identify areas of independent living in which the consumer may benefit from the use of assistive technology, as well as helping them identify resources to acquire the needed AT.  To broaden the scope of the training and attract a wider audience MassMATCH engaged Dr. Kevin Berner of Easter Seals MA to conduct the trainings, and provided professional education credits for various professional who took the trainings. 
Participants included staff of local Aging and Disability Resource Consortia organizations, such as transition coordinators, waiver case managers, housing search entities, options counselors, Adult Family Care programs, Veterans Service Officers, Supported Living Providers, etc..  With the increased clinical focus and CEUs, this training series was able to attract other professionals such as nurses, social workers and Occupational therapists.  A total of 208 individuals attended the 9 training sessions across the state.</p>

                <p>Describe Innovative one high-impact assistance activity that is not related to transition:</p>
                <p id="taB1">The Weight and Seating Independence Project was funded by the Christopher and Dana Reeves Foundation in FY17 and FY18, to provide access to wheelchair scales and pressure mapping technology to people with paralysis living in Western Mass.  At the end of the grant period MassMATCH decided to expand the project statewide.  During the project it had become clear that the sole PMT brand in the inventory was inadequate, and the ATRC staff decided to find another brand to add to the inventory. Kobena Bonney, the MassMATCH Program Coordinator, provided technical assistance to the two ATRC providers to help them determine what pressure mapping device to purchase.  MassMATCH staff helped the ATRCs research available options and they were able to identify which brand to purchase.  As a result, users of the device demo and loan program now have multiple PMT systems to choose from the inventory.</p>
                <p>Breifly describe one technical assistance activity related to transition conducted during the reporting period:</p>
                <p id="taB2">During the 2018 Fiscal Year,  MassMATCH staff provided additional technical assistance to the Independent Living Center in Springfield, MA in connection with the Weight and Seating Independence Project. The primary goal of the WSIP is to enable individuals with SCI successfully live in the community. MassMATCH staff helped the ILC determine the best way to address a major problem with the wheelchair accessible platform scale at their location. The scale stop working for a while. When MassMATCH staff became aware of the situation, they intervened. Kobena Bonney, the program Coordinator reach out to the local ILC staff to help them diagnose the cause of the problem. He then worked with all the relevant parties to ensure all the necessary steps were taken resulting in the successful repair and recalibration of the scale.

                <p id="Narrative1">1. During FY18 MassMATCH conducted targeted public AT presentations/demonstrations in connection with a new grant award we received from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. The award is funding our Weight and Seating Independence Project (WSIP), which aims to improve the independence, autonomy and control of health and wellness by persons with paralysis in central and western Massachusetts by increasing awareness of and providing access to digital pressure mapping technology and wheelchair accessible scales in the least restrictive environment.
As a result of the success of the Reeve Foundation funded one-year project, we decided to expand the Weight and Seating Independence Project statewide. We also incorporated the equipment into our existing device demo and loan programs in order to ensure its sustainability.  We carried out additional public outreach to publicize the expansion of the project and wider availability of the equipment.  We hosted four Open House events in different areas across the state. Those events were open to the public and we took the opportunity to celebrate the success of WSIP and demonstrated both the PMT and the wheelchair accessible scales. We also created a separate WSIP website where we posted information and resources about the project such as manuals, videos, etc.  Other public awareness activities included electronic and printed flyers, Facebook/blog postings, newsletter and email articles, etc.  In addition to the Open House events, MassMATCH staff brought examples of both the accessible scales and the pressure mapping technology to some of the larger conferences and events we attended, such as the 3-day Abilities Expo Boston, the annual Human Service Providers Conference, and the annual statewide ADA celebration hosted by the Statewide Independent Living Council. From the feedback we received, the presentations/demonstrations were very successful as they provided participants with valuable information about available AT resources in the state as well as concrete evidence of the impact of AT.</p>
